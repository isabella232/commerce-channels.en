# Listing Price

[!UICONTROL Listing Price] settings are part of your store listing settings. Listing settings are accessed from the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

These settings define which [!DNL Commerce] pricing attribute to use as your price source, which is the base (default) price value for your Amazon listings. These settings are used by your [pricing rules](./pricing-rule-general-settings.md) to automatically adjust your Amazon listing price relative to the value set for _[!UICONTROL Magento Price Source]_.

You can configure your [pricing scope](./price-scope.md) as global or website. If your pricing scope is set to `Global`, there is a single price source for all your stores/websites. If your pricing scope is set to `Website`, the price source uses fallback logic of website price (if available) followed by the default (global) price.

If a listing rule is set to apply to more than one website, the order in which website price is used is determined by the website priority setting defined in the [listing rule](./listing-rules.md). These rules allow you to define product pricing across your catalog. To see if you are using website price scope, see [Catalog Price Scope](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/catalog-price-scope.html){target="_blank"}.

The options listed in _[!UICONTROL Magento Price Source]_, _[!UICONTROL Minimum Advertised Price (Map)]_, and _[!UICONTROL Strike Through Price (MSRP)]_ include your configured Pricing attributes. Pricing attributes are [!DNL Commerce] product attributes with the Catalog Input Type for Store Owner value set to `Price`. See [Attribute Input Types](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/attributes-input-types.html){target="_blank"}.

## Configure Listing Price settings {#configure-listing-price-settings}

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Listing Settings]** on the store dashboard.

1. Expand the _[!UICONTROL Listing Price]_ section.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Magento Price Source]** (required), choose an option.

   The default is `Price`. This setting determines the price source used for your Amazon listings. If you create [pricing rules](./pricing-products.md), the rules are applied to the value defined for the attribute selected here. You can select any configured pricing attribute. However, if the selected attribute is not filled in for a product, the price source for the product defaults back to `Price` when pricing rules are applied to determine the published Amazon listing price.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Minimum Advertised Price (MAP)**], choose an option.

   The default is no selection. This setting enables a minimum advertised price (MAP) for a product. When you define a pricing attribute and your listing price for a product falls below your determined minimum price (based on your pricing source and rules), this value becomes the MAP for the listing. This setting allows you to implement [pricing rules](./pricing-products.md), while still controlling your minimum price for a product. To prevent a listing price from being too low, choose a pricing attribute to use as your MAP. However, if the selected pricing field is not defined for a product, the MAP is not used.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Strike Through Price (MSRP)]**, choose an option.

   The default is no selection. This setting determines which pricing attribute is used as the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) for a product. If your listing price is less than the defined MSRP, your Amazon listing is displayed with a strike-through of the MSRP price with the lower listing price, along with the calculated "You Save" amount and percentage. However, if the selected pricing field is not defined for a product, the MSRP is not calculated.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >This setting only applies to listings that have won the [Buy Box](./buy-box-competitor-pricing.md) position. The Buy Box is awarded by Amazon to the seller who has the product listed usually at the best price, along with other factors such as FBA/Prime shipping offered, availability, and the seller's performance.

1. For **Apply Value Added Tax (VAT)**, choose an option:

   - `Disabled` - (Default) Choose when you do not want to apply VAT to your listing price.

   - `Enabled` - Choose when you want to apply VAT to your listing price. VAT is typically used as a sales tax in European countries and is added to your final listed price within Amazon. VAT does not apply to final price for listings that are used within an intelligent pricing rule, unless the [floor price](./floor-price.md) is hit.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Businesses in the European Union (EU) are required to send invoices to business buyers, so that the customer can remit tax. You can either generate these invoices and calculate the taxes yourself or use a tax calculation service such as Amazon's VAT Calculation Service. Amazon recommends signing up for the [Amazon VAT Calculation Service](https://sell.amazon.co.uk/learn/vat-resources?ref_=asuk_soa_rd&){target="_blank"}. If you choose a different method, you are responsible for VAT compliance.>
   >
   >It may take 10-14 days for Amazon to verify and activate your VAT Calculation Service account.

1. For **[!UICONTROL VAT Percentage]**, enter the value for your VAT rate.

   The default is `0.00`. This value is used to calculate the VAT amount to be added to the listing price. If `10.2` is entered, a 10.20% VAT is applied to your listing price. This field is disabled when the Apply Value Added Tax (VAT) field is set to `Disabled`.

1. **(UK Stores Only)** For **[!UICONTROL Amazon Product Tax Code (PTC)]**, choose an option:

   - `Do Not Manage PTC` - (Default) Choose if you are using a third-party tax calculation service or already have all your tax calculations set up in your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account. When chosen, Amazon sales channel sends no product tax code information to your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account.

   - `Set Default PTC` - Choose if you have a universal product tax code (PTC) you want to use for all your products. When chosen, you must complete _[!UICONTROL Default PTC]_.

      - For **[!UICONTROL Default PTC]**, enter the default PTC to be used for all eligible Amazon listings. If your default PTC is set in your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account, leave this field blank. Changes made to this field do not affect existing Amazon listings. To change the Default PTC for an existing listing, the listing must be [ended](./end-listings-manually.md) and a new listing created.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you use Amazon's VAT Calculation Service, you must know the tax category for your products. A PTC is Amazon's tax category ID code for B2B purchases in the EU. See [Amazon's Product Tax Codes](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G200794510&language=en_US){target="_blank"}.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Currency Conversion]**, choose an option.

   The default is `Disabled`. These options depend on your [!DNL Commerce] [currency](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/general/currency-setup.html){target="_blank"} settings. If no options are available, set up your currency settings.

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save listing settings]**.
